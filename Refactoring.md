# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

**The code has been refactored to make it more readable and maintainable. Some of the changes are**:
* Moved the constant declarations outside the function to improve readability and avoid unnecessary redeclarations.
* Extracted the hash computation and stringification of the candidate to separate functions for readability and modularity.
* Simplified the candidate assignment logic by combining the two nested if statements into a single if-else statement.
* Reorganized the code so that the "happy path" (i.e., the most common and expected execution flow) is at the top of the function, followed by the error handling (i.e., the case where the candidate is too long). This makes it easier to follow the logic of the function and avoids unnecessary computations.
* Used more descriptive function and variable names to improve readability and maintainability.
